# Abalone_Kaggle_Regression
These are a few Algorithms and libraries I used for the Regression Problem on Kaggle.

`Abalone Notebook` is implemented using Tensorflow and Keras.

`Regression with Abalone` implements XGBoost, SKLearn's Ensemble Forest and Catboost.

`Abalone Regressor`uses Catboost for the model and is Hyperparameter tuned using Optuna.

Cat-Boost Result 1 and Result-2 were obtained using GridSearchCV Hyperparameter tuning. CatBoost-Model-1 was obtained from the same.

Optuna performed better at hyper tuning. For better results, increase no. of epochs in Optuna.
